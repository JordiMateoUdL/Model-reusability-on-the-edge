# Model reusability on the edge

In the context of edge computing, model reusability can be defined as the ability of two nodes to exchange and reuse other work. Thus, we need to know which nodes in the network are similar and what is the direction of reusability.

## Methodology
### Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
